/**
 * A variable that is declared outside of a function is global 
 * and can be accessed by any function in your js code
 * 
 * If you declare a variable within a function without the keyword "var"
 * that variable will be a global automatically. It can be accessed anywhere in the program
 * Variables with the "var" keyword declared in a function will be scoped to that function
 * 
 * To avoid accidentally creating global variables, 
 * itâ€™s best practice to declare variables explicitly with "let", "const", or "var".
